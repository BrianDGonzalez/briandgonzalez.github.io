We are a dynamic research group at [Moffitt Cancer Center](http://www.moffitt.org) in the [Department of Health Outcomes and Behavior](https://moffitt.org/research-science/divisions-and-departments/population-science/health-outcomes-and-behavior/). Our research aims to improve quality of life for people affected by cancer.

We create new models for predicting which cancer patients/survivors will be affected by quality of life issues. We also develop new interventions to help cancer patients/survivors improve their quality of life.

We are located at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, FL.

 **We are  looking for passionate new Postdocs and Research Scientists to join the team**


We are grateful for funding from Moffitt Cancer Center, the National Cancer Institute, and the US Department of Defense.
